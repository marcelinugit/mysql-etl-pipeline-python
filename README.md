# 🐍 MySQL ETL Pipeline (Python)

This project was built as part of my learning journey to become a Software Engineer / Data Engineer, focusing on building real-world ETL pipelines using Python and MySQL.

A simple ETL pipeline built with Python that extracts data from a MySQL database and exports it to CSV files.

---

# 💡 Motivation

This project simulates a real ETL pipeline used in data engineering systems, where data is extracted from a database, processed, and stored in a structured format for further analysis.

It was built to practice:
- Clean Architecture
- Separation of Responsibilities
- Dependency Injection
- ETL concepts (Extract → Transform → Load)

---

# 🚀 Features

- Connects to MySQL database
- Executes SQL queries
- Transforms results into structured data (`list[dict]`)
- Exports data to CSV files
- Environment-based configuration (`.env`)
- Modular and scalable architecture

---

# 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python
- MySQL
- python-dotenv

# 🏗️ Project Structure

```text
src/
├── clients/        # MySQL connection layer
├── config/         # Environment settings (.env loader)
├── jobs/           # ETL pipeline logic
└── main.py         # Application entry point

tests/              # Unit tests
bucket/             # Output CSV files
```

---

# ⚙️ How it works

Data flows through the pipeline:

MySQL Database → MySQLClient → ETL Job → CSV File (bucket/)

---

# 🔧 Setup

## 1. Clone repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/mysql-etl-pipeline-python.git
cd mysql-etl-pipeline-python
```

## 2. Create virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

Activate:

Windows:
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

Linux/Mac:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

## 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

# 🔐 Environment Variables (.env)

Create a `.env` file in the root folder:

```env
MYSQL_HOST=localhost
MYSQL_USER=your_user
MYSQL_PASSWORD=your_password
MYSQL_DATABASE=your_database

OUTPUT_PATH=./bucket
```

---

# ▶️ Run the project

```bash
python src/main.py
```

---

# 🧠 Architecture Highlights

This project applies:
- Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- Dependency Injection
- Separation of Concerns
- Modular design
- Reusable components

---

# 📦 Output

After execution, CSV files will be generated in:

```text
bucket/
```

---

# 📚 Learning Focus
